# âœ¨ Tether - Web-Based SSH Access Right in Your Browser

Tether is a web-based SSH solution that empowers deployment engineers, site reliability engineers, and infrastructure teams to securely connect to remote servers without leaving the browser environment. With Tether, you donâ€™t need a local terminal or complicated SSH setupâ€”just click, connect, and get to work!

## ðŸš€ What is Tether?

Imagine youâ€™re on the go, or maybe using a device without a terminal at hand. Tether lets you jump into a secure SSH session straight from your web browser. It leverages Django and Channels to provide real-time, bi-directional communication with remote hostsâ€”like a browser-based terminal on steroids! Tether was created to discourage ssh owners to share important credentials directly with each other. Instead the permitted user can directly login to tether and they are provided with options to connect to the server directly.

## ðŸ”’ Security First

Tether enforces strict object-level permissions so only authorized users can view and connect to specific hosts. This ensures that no one can access servers theyâ€™re not supposed to, safeguarding your infrastructureâ€™s integrity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

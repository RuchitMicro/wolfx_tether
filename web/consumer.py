    SSHConsumer is responsible for handling a WebSocket that proxies
    a remote SSH session. This allows a browser terminal (xterm.js) to
    interactively communicate with a remote host over SSH.

    This consumer:
    - On connect: retrieves the Host data, sets up SSH connection, and opens a shell.
    - On receive: sends incoming data from client to the SSH shell input or handles control commands.
    - On disconnect: closes the SSH connection.

    Run paramiko in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop.

    Always handle exceptions gracefully and send an appropriate message
    back to the user if something fails.
